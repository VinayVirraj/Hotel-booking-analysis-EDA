# Hotel-booking-analysis-EDA

Dataset describes two sorts of hotels, City and resort. Dataset features a combined
booking details which forms dataset of 1,19,390 rows and 32 columns. Each
observation describes all the relevant information about the hotel.

I performed Exploratory data Analysis with python to urge meaningful insights
from the info , to assist the hotel take key decisions which can help them to
enhance their performance in market also as profits too.

I started my work with Data cleaning I.e to take out null values. In dataset,
company column was the only one which had null values more than 50% and so we
decided to drop it. Using different types of plots to gain insights is key to a good
EDA. We used 5 different types of plots in present data as well as gaining insights.

The term meaningful is very important in EDA. We can’t plot graphs of all features
and present them. Insights must be meaningful which should be used in further
decision making. I did some Not-Too-Complicated visualisations which sought to
give best results. I tend to use sea-born more easily than any other visualisation
library, although I realised Matplotlib offer greater customisation and flexibility.

I derived some insights and some measure that can be taken by hotel to improve
their performance. On personal intake, I am now much more confident with seaborn
and matplotlib than before, I carefully understood concept behind what’s a
meaningful insight and importance of EDA in any project.
